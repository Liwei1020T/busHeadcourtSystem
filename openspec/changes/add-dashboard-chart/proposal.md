## Why
Operators need a quick visual read on headcount trends; the dashboard currently only shows tables and a placeholder analytics card.

## What Changes
- Add a headcount visualization that summarizes totals by date and shift using the existing filters
- Replace the analytics placeholder on the Bus Dashboard with an interactive chart and legend
- Document the new chart behavior alongside the dashboard features

## Impact
- Affected specs: dashboard-analytics
- Affected code: BusDashboard page, new chart component, dashboard docs
